# Arch Linux - IPFS Sync Tool 🚀

Synchronize your Arch Linux repositories with IPFS seamlessly using the Arch Linux - IPFS Sync Tool! This tool automates the process of checking for, installing, and running Kubo (the Arch Linux IPFS implementation), setting up IPFS, and syncing the `core` and `extra` repositories of Arch Linux to your local machine and IPFS.
